export default About

// Software Engineer with a passion for writing scalable solutions
//  in JavaScript, and SQL. Strong drive to confront intimidating or
//   complex problems that can arise in front and back-end programming
//    hoisted by a belief that with a positive attitude and understanding,
//     no problem is greater than a person or team willing to come
//      together and solve it. I look forward to a future of writing more
//       complex applications and tools to make people's lives easier and more
//        leisurely, because I believe great software can change the world.
